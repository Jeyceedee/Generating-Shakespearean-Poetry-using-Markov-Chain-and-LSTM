# Generating-Shakespearean-Poetry-using-Markov-Chain-and-LSTM
The Shakesperean Poetry Generator generate completely new poems in the style of Shakespeare.

With this tool, you can explore the beauty and complexity of Shakespeare's poetic language, and create your own original pieces that capture the essence of his writing.

The Shakespearean Poetry Generator uses a combination of Markov chain and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to generate text that mimics the style and structure of Shakespeare's writing. Markov chains are used to generate new sentences based on the statistical patterns found in Shakespeare's works, while LSTM models take into account the word before the previous word, as well as the words that have already been generated, to produce more coherent and fluid poetic lines.
